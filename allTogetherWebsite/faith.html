                <h2>What is Faith?</h2>
                <p>
                Faith is to have confidence in something or someone. Faith is a principle of action and of power.
                As children of God, we must exercise faith by acting on our beliefs. 
                We come to know the truth of these beliefs through the confirmation of the Holy Spirit.

                of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</p>

                    Faith is to hope for things which are not seen, but which are true, and must be centered in Jesus Christ in order to produce salvation.
                    Faith in Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel.

            We wouldn't follow down the Gospel path an want to repent and be more like him. 
            I am greatful for this activity to work hard and put this website together.</p>
